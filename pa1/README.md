# Programming Assignment 1

This program aims to build an Integer List ADT in C and use it to indirectly alphabetize the lines in a file.

## Files

1. List.c - List ADT

2. List.h - Contains the List ADT interface

3. Lex.c - Contains the main file of the program, and lexicographically orders file using the List ADT

4. MakeFile - Complies and builds the program

5. Readme.md - describes how the program will run

## How to Build

1. Have all the .c and .h files to be able to build the program

To construct the files

```python
make
```

## Usage

Once the program is built, Lex can be called using an input and output file

```python
./Lex input.txt output.txt
```
