# Programming Assignment 3

This program aims to build a Graph ADT in C and some associated algorithms in C.

## Files

1. Graph.h - Graph ADT

2. Graph.h - Contains the Graph ADT interface
 
1. List.c - List ADT

2. List.h - Contains the List ADT interface

3. FindComponents.c - Contains the main file of the program, and will use the Graph ADT to find strongly connected sources in the Graph

4. MakeFile - Complies and builds the program

5. Readme.md - describes how the program will run

## How to Build

1. Have all the .c and .h files to be able to build the program

To construct the files

```python
make
```

## Usage

Once the program is built, FindComponents can be called using an input and output file

```python
./FindComponents input.txt output.txt
```
