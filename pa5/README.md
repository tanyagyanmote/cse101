# Programming Assignment 5

This program aims to build a List ADT in C++ and some associated algorithms in C.

## Files
 
1. List.c - List ADT

2. List.h - Contains the List ADT interface

3. Shuffle.c - Contains the main file of the program, and will use the List ADT to do operations on a List, Shuffling a deck of cards

4. MakeFile - Complies and builds the program

5. Readme.md - describes how the program will run

## How to Build

1. Have all the .c and .h files to be able to build the program

To construct the files

```python
make
```

## Usage

Once the program is built, Sparse can be called using an input and output file

```python
./Shuffle 
```
