# Programming Assignment 5

This program aims to build a List ADT in C++ and some associated algorithms in C.

## Files
 
1. List.cpp - List ADT

2. List.h - Contains the List ADT interface

3. BigInteger.cpp - Big Integer ADT 

3. BigInteger.h - Contains the BigInteger ADT interface

3. BigIntegerTest.cpp - Big Integer Test Suite

3. ListTest.cpp - List Test Suite

3. Arithmetic.cpp - Contains the main file of the program, and will use the List, and BigInteger ADT to do operations on a BigInteger

4. MakeFile - Complies and builds the program

5. Readme.md - describes how the program will run

## How to Build

1. Have all the .c and .h files to be able to build the program

To construct the files

```python
make
```

## Usage

Once the program is built, Arithmetic can be called using two input numbers

```python
./Arithmetic in.txt out,txt
```
